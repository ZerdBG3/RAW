DnD Rebalancing for Baldur's Gate 3
=======

# DISCLAIMER
* The main goal behind an Early Access is to provide meaningful feedback to the developers. To do so, Larian implemented an automatic telemetry that will provide data for them automatically as you play
* Since modding BG3 is not yet officially supported by Larian Studios, you might encounter unexpected problems that it's not in their current scope to fix. **PLEASE DISABLE AUTOMATIC TELEMETRY** and don't post bug reports on their official platforms, as you're playing an unsuported mod
* How to disable telemetry:

# Description
* This mod's main objective is to rebalance BG3 removing some of Larian's takes on the ruleset and adapting it to more closely resemble the tabletop experience.

# Features:
* Fighting Style is available for Fighters at level 1 (from level 2)
* Firebolt deals 1d10 (from 1d6) but does not create a fire surface (it still interacts with surfaces below the target)
* Ray of Frost does not create an ice surface (it still interacts with surfaces below the target)
* Jump, Hide and Shove are all actions (from bonus actions)
* Introduced Disengage as an action to all characters (without Jump tied to it) - **TESTING**
* Cunning Action (Rogue level 2) now gives Hide and Disengage (besides Dash) as bonus actions as well

# Installing
* Download the `.pak` file from [Releases](https://github.com/ZerdBG3/DnD-Rebalancing/releases) and place it under `\Documents\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Mods`
* Copy the `modsettings.lsx` file on the root and place it under `Documents\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\PlayerProfiles\{YOUR_PROFILE}`, where `{YOUR_PROFILE}` is the profile you want the mod to be active on
* **IMPORTANT:** When loading the game, you'll get a notification regarding an invalid story set-up. Since the mod doesn't have any story files, the fallback to the main story allows the game to load correctly. Tl;dr: ignore the error warning you'll get
* If you're very annoyed by this warning message, you can also use [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/13) to suppress the warning message
