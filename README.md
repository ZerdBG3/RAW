DnD Rebalancing for Baldur's Gate 3
=======

# DISCLAIMER
* The main goal behind an Early Access is to provide meaningful feedback to the developers. To do so, Larian implemented an automatic telemetry that will provide data for them automatically as you play
* Since modding BG3 is not yet officially supported by Larian Studios, you might encounter unexpected problems that it's not in their current scope to fix. **PLEASE DISABLE AUTOMATIC TELEMETRY** and don't post bug reports on their official platforms, as you're playing with an unsuported mod
* How to disable telemetry:

# Description
* This mod's main objective is to modify vanilla content so that it respects D&D 5th edition ruleset. This means removing some of Larian's takes on the ruleset and adapting it to more closely resemble the tabletop experience. As of right now, the guideline followed is the Player's Handbook and Dungeon's Master Guide contents.

# Features
* See all current features [here](https://github.com/ZerdBG3/DnD-Rebalancing/blob/main/Features.md)

# Installing
* Download the latest `.pak` file from [Releases](https://github.com/ZerdBG3/DnD-Rebalancing/releases) and place it under `\Documents\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Mods` (Create the `Mods` folder if it doesn't exist)
* Use Laughing Leader's [Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager) to set up your mod profile
* If you want to set up your mods manually, here's an [Installation Guide](https://github.com/ZerdBG3/DnD-Rebalancing/blob/main/Installing.md)

# Compatibility
* This mod alters a lot of core mechanics, thus it might not be compatible with saves that were started without it. If possible, start a new game when using this mod
* There's also various modifications to classes progressions, spells, actions, etc. This means other mods that change the same entries might cause conflict. Using other mods may result in weird interactions and not intended behaviors

# Error
* **IMPORTANT:** When loading the game, you'll get a notification regarding an invalid story set-up. Since the mod doesn't have any story files, the fallback to the main story allows the game to load correctly. Tl;dr: ignore the error warning you'll get
* If you're very annoyed by this warning message, you can also use [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/227) to suppress the warning message (among other things)
