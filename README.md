# Description
* This mod's main objective is to modify vanilla content so that it respects D&D 5th edition ruleset. This means removing some of Larian's takes on the ruleset and adapting it to more closely resemble the tabletop experience. As of right now, the guideline followed is the Player's Handbook and Dungeon's Master Guide contents.
* However, not all original rules are applicable or possible to be implemented on BG3. Therefore, this is my personal take on how better to apply 5e's ruleset to BG3.

# Features
* See all current features [here](https://github.com/ZerdBG3/RAW/blob/main/Features.md)

# Installing
* Installation and updating instructions are found on the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/ZerdBG3/RAW/blob/main/Installing.md)
* This mod requires Norbyte's [BG3 Script Extender](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se/releases)

# Compatibility
* This mod alters a lot of core mechanics, thus it might not be compatible with saves that were started without it. If possible, start a new game when using this mod
  * _The option `[invisibility](https://github.com/ZerdBG3/RAW/blob/main/Features.md#invisibility-%EF%B8%8F-invisibility)` is known to cause bugs on existing saves. Make sure to disable it if you're planning to add this mod on an on-going save._
* There's also various modifications to classes progressions, spells, actions, etc. This means other mods that change the same entries might cause conflict. Using other mods may result in weird interactions and not intended behaviors

# Recommendations
* Here are some of the mods I recommend using alongside this one, which all follow a RAW philosophy
  - Arnaud's [RAW Addon](https://github.com/BG3-RAW-Mods/bg3-RAW-addon): expands on RAW changes, implementing things I didn't get to do yet
  - Celes' [5e Spells](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/125): needs no introduction. Adds a bunch of spells, all following 5e rules
  - dr. kekyll's [Summon Initiative Fixer](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8692?tab=description): pairs well with the [`intangibleSummons`](https://github.com/ZerdBG3/RAW/blob/main/Features.md#intangible-summons-%EF%B8%8F-intangiblesummons) option from this mod, guaranteeing the appropriate summons will play at the same turn as the caster
  - jjdoorframe's [True Darkness](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/13542): makes the Darkness spell RAW, which is such a huge work that it justifies being a whole mod on its own

# Languages
* In-game content is currently translated to the following languages
  - English
  - German (MichaLHN)
  - Italian ([Kilay](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/26711484))
  - Portuguese - Brazilian (Rorerik)
  - Russian ([Aks_kun](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Aks2aidos))

# Error
* **IMPORTANT:** When opening the launcher, you'll get several notifications telling you about how mods might break and crash your game. Ignore them
* When loading the game or creating a new one, you'll get a notification regarding an invalid story set-up. Since the mod doesn't have any story files, the fallback to the main story allows the game to load correctly. Tl;dr: ignore the error warning you'll get
